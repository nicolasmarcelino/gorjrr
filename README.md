gorjrr is a single timeline social platform and every post follows a simple structure: author, content and date of posting.

Considerations:
- Posts are limited to 280 characters
- Authors' names are limited to 20 characters
- The author's name is not reserved (if you posted something under the name "jdoe", anyone can make other posts with that same name)
- The project is not officially hosted

This simple application was developed and tested in a local environment using XAMPP.
